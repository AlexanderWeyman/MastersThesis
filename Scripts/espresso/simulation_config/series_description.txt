NVT_equi_dilute (not considered in evaluation):
- EquilibrationForNPTRuns: N_P=30, MPC=30, delta_s=0,1,2,3, lB=7.0, rho=0.0140625 (corresponds to box_l=40 sigma), mpirun with n=4, first NVT equilibration for Tmax=3000 with no additional analysis, set up of denser system lead to broken bond errors that could not be fixed with reasonable minimizing the warmup timestep
- NPTequi01: continuation of equilibration in the npt ensemble: NPTPressure=0.0036, Tmax=100000 (maximum time after which simulation is stopped, can stop earlier if averaged relative pressure error is below tolerance of 5%), mpirun with n=4, except for npt_info no further analysis

NVT_equi_dilutev2 (not considered in evaluation):
- NPTequi01: same as from NVT_equi_dilute-NPTequi01 except ncpus=16

densePIL_BoxlRamp (not considered in evaluation):
- postNPT: continuation of NVT_equi_dilutev2 in 'nvt' ensemble (boxlength is adjusted with 'ramp' to obtain target concentration which in turn corresponds to a volume fraction of 0.3. Tmax=130000 (addition 30000 time units), new vtf and analyze files, equi_temp=4.0 (for numerical stability, fene bonds break for 5.0), box_l_change_factor=0.0001
-> it turned out that the monomer concentrations were calculated without the counterions. this leads to varying packing fractions (depending on deltaS)

densePILv2:
- diluteSetup: N_P=30, MPC=30, delta_s=0,1,2,3, lB=7.0, rho=0.0140625 (corresponds to box_l=40 sigma), equi_temp=1.0, Tmax=1000

- diluteSetup03: equi_temp=3.0, Tmax=3000 (additional 1000 t.u.), same rho -> failed: broken bonds for EACH sclen -> restart with equi_temp=2.5 (sclen=2 failed at the first try, restart with different seed succeded)
- diluteSetup04: equi_temp=2.75, Tmax=4000 (additional 1000 t.u.), same rho -> sclen=0 failed at first try, restart with different seed succeded, because of missing checkpoint at T=3000, trajectory and analysis between 3000 and 3250 missing (used old subcheckpoint 3250)
- diluteSetup05: equi_temp=3.0, Tmax=5000, same rho -> failed: broken bonds for EACH sclen at first try -> restart with different seeds (sclen=3 took 2 additional tries)

- postDilute02: continuation of postDilute with equi_temp=2.0, Tmax=200000, target rhos to achieve phi=0.3, box_l_change_factor=0.0001, retune p3m every 250 iterations
